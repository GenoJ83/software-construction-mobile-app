**Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration**



**2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems**

Poor maintainability occurs when code is hard to understand, modify, or debug due to issues like cryptic variable names, lack of comments, tight coupling, duplicated logic, or absent tests.

A real-world situation: Legacy banking or healthcare systems often suffer from this. For example, a hospital's patient management system built over decades with poorly documented, spaghetti-like code (tangled logic across thousands of lines) can become nearly impossible to update safely. When regulations require adding new privacy features or fixing a security vulnerability, developers struggle to make changes without introducing new bugs. In extreme cases, this has delayed critical updates, risked patient data breaches, or even contributed to system downtime during emergencies—potentially endangering lives or causing massive financial/regulatory penalties.
